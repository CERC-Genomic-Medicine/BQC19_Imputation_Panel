# Imputation Pipelines

Welcome to the Imputation project, a comprehensive suite of pipelines designed for phasing, imputation, meta-imputation, and post-imputation analysis. With these tools at your disposal, you can take full control of your genomics data, ensuring high-quality imputation and analysis.

## Key Features
- **Build Your Own Local Reference Panel**: Utilize whole genome sequencing data to construct a personalized local reference panel.
- **Impute Genotyping Array Data**: Leverage your local reference panel to impute missing data from genotyping arrays, enhancing the completeness and accuracy of your genotyping array dataset.
- **Meta-Imputation**: Combine imputation results from multiple panels to optimize data quality and integrity.
- **Post-Imputation Analysis**: Evaluate and assess the performance of your imputation using our robust post-imputation analysis tools.

## Pipelines Overview

### 1. Statistical Phasing Pipeline
Construct a high-quality reference panel tailored to your specific genomic data. ([statistical phasing](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/statistical_phasing))

### 2. Pre-Phasing and Imputation Pipeline
Prepare your data and perform imputation, ensuring accuracy and completeness. ([imputation](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/imputation), [pre-phasing](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/reference_based_phasing))

### 3. Meta-Imputation Pipeline
Combine results from multiple imputation panels to enhance data integrity and quality. ([meta-imputation](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/meta_imputation))

### 4. Post-Imputation Analysis Pipelines
Assess and validate the performance of your imputation, ensuring confidence in your results. ([Imputed vs Truth](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/imputed_vs_truth), [Imputed vs Imputed](https://github.com/CERC-Genomic-Medicine/BQC19_Imputation_Panel/tree/master/Benchmark/imputed_vs_imputed))
